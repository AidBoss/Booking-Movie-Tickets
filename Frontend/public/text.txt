Last summer, I went to Ha Long Bay for three days with my family. We traveled there by car, enjoying the beautiful 
scenery along the way. We stayed at a cozy hotel near the beach. During our vacation, we took a bout tour to explore 
the islands and visited Sung Sot cave. I enjoyed swimming in the clear water and eating delicious seafood, I felt 
very happy and relaxed during the trip. The stunning views and fresh air made a perfect getaway, I hope that we 
can go to back to there i the future.

movies 
My favorite movie is "The Pursuit Of Happy", It was released in 2006 are derected by Gabriele Muccion. It tells 
the spiring true story of Chris Gardner, who stuggles with homelessness while trying to improvide a better life 
for his son. The performances by Will Smith and his son are credible, making the emotions very real. I love how 
the film shows the importance of perseverance and hope, even in tough times. The ending is upfiding and reminds 
me that hard work can lead to success. I can watch this movie again and again because it always inpiries help
me to follow my dreams.
